A few issues regarding API at http://docs.dpcs.apiary.io/#:

1) Adding a crash group
According to API, the adding of a crash group should be available with
PUT request, made to the address 'http://server.address.com/vd1/crash-groups'
http://docs.dpcs.apiary.io/#reference/crashes/crash-groups-collection/create-new-crash-group

However, if we take a look at the API for getting crash-groups paths
http://docs.dpcs.apiary.io/#reference/0/api-paths/get-api-paths
we will notice that there is a '/' at the end of the path regarding crash-group:
{
...
"crash-groups": "vd1/crash-groups/",
...
}

Since all of our paths will be taken from GET request at vd1/paths/,
I assumed it was a mistake in apiary, and proceeded with adding a '/' after all,
to save consistency

Also, if we want to add a new request do we want to use PUT method?
If so it would seem inconsistent with how we add a crash report(POST request) or crash group(POST request).
For now I've left the put method to add a new crash group.
    
Current way of adding a crash group:
    PUT request to http://server.address.com/vd1/crash-groups/
        

2)
I have noticed that the model for system information has changed.
New fields, like "packages" and "platform" were added.

Because of the lack of the official information,
in the current version of the django server, those values shall be ignored,
in order to guarantee compability with http://docs.dpcs.apiary.io/#.

3)POSTING new solution
When posting new solution, according to 
http://docs.dpcs.apiary.io/#reference/solutions/solution-collection/post-new-solution, 
we should specify: "crash_group_id", "crash_group_url", and "shell_script".

The question is: why posting crash_group_url ? Isn't crash_group_id enough
for the server to do all the processing? After all crash_group_url is just
constant_string + crash_group_id

4) Same goes for updating crash report, in which according to
http://docs.dpcs.apiary.io/#reference/crashes/crash-report/update-crash-report
we have to specify both crash_report_id and crash_report_url
