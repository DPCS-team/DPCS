# Automatic problem solvers
##### Red Hat Access - Red Hat Access: Diagnose and Red Hat Access: Analyze

It can perform problem determination on error codes, stacktraces, and logs. 
Red Hat Access: Analyze can perform log-file analysis using Red Hat servers.

# Logs as source of data for machine learning
